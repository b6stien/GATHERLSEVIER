# GATHERLSEVIER
This script allows you to instant-download (no captcha or web surfing) the articles you want from libgen.lc

It bypasses any libgen.lc restriction from internet providers (at least in France)

Bulk instant-download of articles is possible if a .txt file containing a different DOI on each line is supplied


HOW TO RUN IT?
1) download and install python if not already done (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) install the requirements (see https://tinyurl.com/y5pww3t7 if you don't know how to do so)
3) run the "gatherlsevier_run.py" file and follow instructions
