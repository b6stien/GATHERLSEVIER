# GATHERLSEVIER
This script allows you to instant-download (no captcha or web surfing) the articles you want from libgen.lc and sci-hub.tw

It bypasses any libgen.lc restriction from internet providers (at least in France)

Bulk instant-download of articles is possible if a .txt file containing a different DOI on each line is supplied

PDF files are saved in the "saved references" folder
